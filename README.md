# Wikipedia Search

Wikipedia Search is an extension that adds multiple ways to search [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), the free encyclopedia, right in your web browser. You can type "wiki" in the browser search bar, then the Space or Tab key, to start a search with live suggestions as you type. Also, selecting a word or phrase in a web page and opening the context menu will show a Wikipedia search option. 

You can change the default search language to any language Wikipedia supports, and the optional multi-language search feature can override it with a different choice. Search results can be opened in the desktop Wikipedia site, the mobile site, or [Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/).
